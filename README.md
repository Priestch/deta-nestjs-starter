# The Quick NestJS Starter of Deta Space

It took me some time to figure out how to deploy a NestJS app to [Deta](https://deta.space/), I created this starter
to make it easy to get you started. This starter is generated using the NestJS CLI. 

# How to use
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Priestch/deta-nestjs-starter.git && cd deta-nestjs-starter

space new
# Follow the prompts and you are good to go

space push

```
Clone the repo and run `space new`, make sure you have the Deta Space CLI installed. If you encounter any issues, please
refer to the official [documentation](https://deta.space/docs/en/build/new-apps).
