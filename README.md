# The Quick NestJS Starter of Deta Space

It took me some time to figure out how to deploy a NestJS app to [Deta](https://deta.space/), So I created this starter
to make it easy to get you started. This starter is generated using the NestJS CLI. 

# How to use
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Priestch/deta-nestjs-starter.git && cd deta-nestjs-starter

# Create a new Deta Micro instance
space new
# Follow the prompts and you are good to go

# Push to Deta
space push

# It takes seconds to deploy.
# Once successfully deployed, you should see message like this
# âœ“ Successfully pushed your code and updated your Builder instance!
# Builder instance: https://nestjsstarter-1-k1690852.deta.app

```
